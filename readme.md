# VSG (V Site Generator)

Personal tools for generating websites using V.

I made these for my website however decided to rip them out and make a library
using it so that I can use VSG in other projects too.

## Installation

`v install EmmaTheMartian.vsg`

## Modules

`css` - Contains the VCSS source, which is a superset of CSS adding inheritence.

`html` - The pride and joy of VSG :P

## Usage

> For an example using VCSS and VSG's HTML module, see my website's source code [here](https://github.com/emmathemartian/emmathemartian.github.io).

```v
// Todo :P
```

## License

VSG is dual-licensed under MIT and the Unlicense. Pick whichever you prefer :P
